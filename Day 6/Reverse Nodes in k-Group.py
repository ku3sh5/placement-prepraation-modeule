# Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

# k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

# You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
# Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
# Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is n.
# 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
# 0 <= Node.val <= 1000

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:        
        # Check if we need to reverse the group
        curr = head
        for _ in range(k):
            if not curr: return head
            curr = curr.next
		        
				
        # Reverse the group (basic way to reverse linked list)
        prev = None
        curr = head
        for _ in range(k):
            nxt = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nxt
        
		
        # After reverse, we know that `head` is the tail of the group.
		# And `curr` is the next pointer in original linked list order
        head.next = self.reverseKGroup(curr, k)
        return prev
    
# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(1)
